# BIDS for MATLAB / Octave

This repository aims at centralising MATLAB/Octave tools to interact with datasets conforming to the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) format.

For more information about BIDS, visit https://bids.neuroimaging.io/.

See also [PyBIDS](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids) for Python and the [BIDS Starter Kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit).

## Implementation

Starting point was `spm_BIDS.m` from [SPM12](https://github.com/spm/spm12) ([documentation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/BIDS#BIDS_parser_and_queries)) reformatted in a `+bids` package with dependencies to other SPM functions removed.

## Example

```Matlab
BIDS = bids.layout('/home/data/ds000117');
bids.query(BIDS, 'subjects')
```
