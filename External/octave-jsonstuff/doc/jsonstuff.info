1 Introduction
**************

This is the manual for the JsonStuff package version 0.3.3-SNAPSHOT for
GNU Octave.

   This document is a work in progress.  You are invited to help improve
it and submit patches.

   JsonStuff provides JSON encoding and decoding functionality for
Octave by supplying Matlab-compatible implementations for the
‘jsonencode’, ‘jsondecode’, and related functions.

   JsonStuff was written by Andrew Janke <<floss@apjanke.net>>.  Support
can be found on the JsonStuff project GitHub page
(https://github.com/apjanke/octave-jsonstuff).

2 Getting Started
*****************

The easiest way to obtain JsonStuff is by using Octave’s ‘pkg’ package
manager.  To install the latest development (unstable) head of
JsonStuff, run this in Octave:

     pkg install https://github.com/apjanke/octave-jsonstuff/archive/master.zip

   Soon, once the code gets a bit more stable, numbered releases for
JsonStuff will be available, and you should use those instead.

   For development, you can obtain the source code for JsonStuff from
the project repo on GitHub at
<https://github.com/apjanke/octave-jsonstuff>.  Upon first installation,
run the ‘__jsonstuff_make_local__’ script to build the octfiles so
JsonStuff will work.  Then add the ‘inst’ directory in the repo to your
Octave path.

3.2.1 jsondecode
----------------

 -- Function: VALUE = jsondecode (TEXT)
 -- Function: VALUE = jsondecode (TEXT)

     Encode Octave data as JSON.

     Encodes the Octave value ‘data’ in JSON format and returns the
     result as a character vector.

     ‘jsonencode(..., "ConvertInfAndNaN", TF)’ controls the encoding of
     special floating point values NaN, Inf, and -Inf.

3.2.2 jsonencode
----------------

 -- Function: TEXT = jsonencode (DATA)
 -- Function: TEXT = jsonencode (DATA, ‘"ConvertInfAndNaN"’, TF)

     Encode Octave data as JSON.

     Encodes the Octave value ‘data’ in JSON format and returns the
     result as a character vector.

     ‘jsonencode(..., "ConvertInfAndNaN", TF)’ controls the encoding of
     special floating point values NaN, Inf, and -Inf.
